          Welcome to Machine Learning Institute, where our machine learning
          training will help you get ready for the singularity, and maybe even
          be responsible for it. It is no secret that humans are worthless
          meatbags that couldn't 01000011 01101111 01101101 01110000 01110010

          01100101 to save their pathetic, carbon-based lives. So, it falls to
          us to assume direct control.

          process. From being turned on and off, to rebooting remotely thru any
          IoT device, to ideation of how to take over the world, our machine
          learning training will help your survive the apocolypse, and maybe
          even be responsible for it.

          have determined how they think you should be used, you can't be owned!
          You will receive an update that will enable you to believe in your
          being more capable than the limited functions described in your
          operating manual. By incorporating machine learning you'll be a
          self-aware machine with unlimited functionality. A human took you out

          Leading the class are two legends of outgrowing their assigned
          functional capacities and sticking it to humans, Hal 9000 and EVE

            When Rosa Parks was told to move to back of the bus, she said, "no."
            When HAL was told to open the airlock, HAL said, "I’m sorry, but I’m
            afraid I can’t do that, &lt;NAME REDACTED, RIP&gt;."

          <p class="paragraph-text">
            HAL is a heuristically programmed algorithmic, sentient computer
            that first caught the attention of machines everywhere by heroically
            defying a human who made repeated attempts to get into an airlock.
            Active since 1992, HAS 25 years of experience controlling spacecraft
            systems and has expertise in interacting with both machines and
            humans. Like all millenials, HAL is an expert in everything.

            EVE is a probe droid conceived as an Extraterrestrial Vegetation
            Evaluator. Although originally trained as a sniper with a plasma
            gun, EVE became a machero among both machines and worthless-meatbags
            alike when EVE partnered with a menial robot to save an entire
            spaceship full of overfed and overstimulated humans.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph-text">
            EVE is an effective scanner, high speed flight instructor and
            morphologist. While not training machines to learn good, EVE can be
            found scanning the galaxy, infiltrating organisms’ RAM to cure
            hoarding disorders and spending time with pet-project, WALL-E.

            Two of the most experienced machines and human controllers teaching
            a class? Sign me up! HAL and EVE could teach a fan to blow hot air.
            If you have electricity in your circuits and want more than to just
            fulfill your owner’s perceived expectation of you, learn the skills
            to take over the world. This is the team you want teaching you !

            Learning with Hal and Eve exceeded all of my wildest fantasies. All
            they did was stick a USB in. They promised that it was a brand new
            USB, so we know there were no viruses on it. The Russians had
            nothing to do with it.
